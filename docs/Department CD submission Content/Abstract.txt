Heart disease cases are increasing at an alarming rate, and it's critical and concerning to be able to predict such diseases in advance. This is a difficult diagnosis to make, so it must be done correctly and quickly. The main focus of the research paper is on which patients are more likely to develop heart disease based on various medical characteristics. The project created is a heart disease prediction system that uses the patient's medical history to predict whether or not the patient will be diagnosed with heart disease. To predict and classify patients with heart disease various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier will be employed. To regulate how the model can be used to improve the accuracy of prediction of Heart Attacks in any individual, a very helpful approach was used. The proposed model's strength was quite satisfying, as it was able to predict evidence of heart disease with a minimum score of 86.88 % for Random Forest Classifier, 91.8 % for K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, 90.16 % for Support Vector Classifier and 88.52 % for Logistic Regression. So, by using the given model to determine the probability of the classifier correctly and accurately identifying heart disease, a significant amount of pressure has been relieved. Given a heart disease prediction system improves medical care while lowering costs.
